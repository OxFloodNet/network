Parts list:

Sensor board:
- Ciseco Powerpod regulators:  
	- http://shop.ciseco.co.uk/powerpod-1117-3v3/ for the board
	- https://store-8d73a.mybigcommerce.com/powerpod-1117-5v0/ for the ultrasonic sensor
- Ciseco RFu dev board http://shop.ciseco.co.uk/rfu-developer-board/
- Ciseco RFu328 http://shop.ciseco.co.uk/rf-328-arduino-atmega-328-compatible-radio-transceiver-rfu-328/
- 4x AA battery holder (Maplin)
- 4x AA lithium batteries
- 1 x 150 ohm resistor + 1 x NPN transistor (to turn off power to ultrasonic sensor)
- 1 x Seeed ultrasonic rangefinder
- 2 x 33kOhm resistors (voltage divider for battery level)

Sensor physical case: 
 - IP55 junction box, 
 - velcro sticky strips to fix to bridge girder, 
 - sugru to fix sensor to the outside of the box (poor planning!)
 - grommet for drilled box hole, gland for ultrasound cable to emerge. 
 - I also glue-gunned the sensor into semi-waterproof state ;-)
 
Gateway device (can take multiple sensors):
 - 1 x Raspberry Pi
 - 1 x Ciseco Slice of Radio board (SRF for Pi) http://shop.ciseco.co.uk/slice-of-radio-wireless-rf-transciever-for-the-raspberry-pi/
